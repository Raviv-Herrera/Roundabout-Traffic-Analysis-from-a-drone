# Roundabout-from-a-drone
Classical Optical-Flow object tracking for cars within a roundabout from a drone bird eye view.

## Description 
The aim of the project is to take an original Video taken by a drone and generate a final result which shows the current vehicles inside the roundabout and track them.
For that purpose we need to stabilize the drone's video, track the vehicles inside and then some interesting statistic inferences can be made.
