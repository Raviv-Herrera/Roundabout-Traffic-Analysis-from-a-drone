# Roundabout-from-a-drone
Classical Optical-Flow object tracking for cars within a roundabout from a drone bird eye view.

## Description 
The aim of the project is to take an original Video taken by a drone and generate a final result which shows the current vehicles inside the roundabout and track them.
For that purpose we need to stabilize the drone's video, track the vehicles inside and then some interesting statistic inferences can be made.

## Pipeline

Stabilize video with homography -->> tracking the vehicles with Optical-Flow algorithm -->> gather relevant data and make statistical inferences -->> show results
